🕵️ Code, Truth, and Verification

Some code runs. Some code tells a story. Some code hides the truth.

Here, the goal is simple: make code prove itself.

🛠️ Breaking down binaries, verifying builds, and questioning assumptions.

📜 Automation, scripting, and cryptographic integrity checks.

🔍 No trust required. Just evidence.
